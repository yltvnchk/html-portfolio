<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Something I take pride in is my diverse work experience.<br /><br />
  I started as a customer support representative, then moved on to teaching English and Ukrainian, and finally ended up in web content management, web development, and SEO.<br />
  Every job equipped me with a range of transferrable soft and tech skills.<br /><br />
  One thing I wake up with every day is a quote from one of my favorite authors, Isaac Asimov:<br/>
  "What's exciting is the actual process of broadening yourself, of knowing there's now a little extra facet of the universe you know about and can think about and can understand."<br /><br />
  I never cease learning, dabbling in new fields and challenging myself every day to keep my mind open and sharp.</p>
